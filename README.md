This is our MP7 for CS125. This a alarm clock with a little creative twist, everytime you snooze you lose. Everytime the 
snooze button is hit a running counter keeps track of the amount of money to withdraw from your account and be donated to 
a charity/friend. We want to offer our users an actual insentive to get up in the morning on time, and thus being effictive 
in our goal.

Feel free to take code and improve and continue to build.
